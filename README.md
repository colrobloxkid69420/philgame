# philgame (temporary name)



## Getting started

To clone the repo do one of these:
```
git clone https://gitlab.com/colrobloxkid69420/philgame #this is for gitlab

git clone https://github.com/colrobloxkid69420/philgame #this is for github
```
If I didn't forget to sync them they should be the same.

I'm too lazy rn to write this readme, maybe I'll do tmr or something.
